            <h2>Hook's Story</h2>
            <p>Captain Hook, born James Hook, was once a man of high society before he became a feared pirate. His story is forever linked to Peter Pan. Hook first met Peter in Neverland, where Peter cut off his hand, forcing him to replace it with a dangerous hook. From that moment on, Hook became obsessed with seeking revenge against Peter Pan.</p>

            <h2>The Fateful Fight</h2>
            <p>During his battle with Peter Pan, Hook lost his right hand to the young boy. Afterward, he was constantly haunted by a crocodile that had swallowed his hand. From that moment on, Hook’s life was consumed by two things: his obsessive hunt for Peter Pan and his fear of the giant, relentless crocodile.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I do not fear the Lost Boys, but the one who never grows up!" - Captain Hook</p>

            <h2>The Crocodile's Pursuit</h2>
            <p>After losing his hand to Peter Pan, Hook was constantly pursued by the monstrous crocodile that had swallowed it. The sound of the crocodile's ticking clock, which echoed as it followed him, became a constant reminder of Hook's looming doom. This drove him deeper into paranoia and fueled his obsessive desire for revenge against Peter Pan.</p>
            <p class="quote">"The ticking of that clock... it haunts me, Pan." - Captain Hook</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>The Man Behind the Hook</h2>
            <p>Despite his cruelty, Captain Hook is a man torn between his thirst for revenge and his inner fears. He is a skilled fencer and a leader with a twisted sense of honor, but he is deeply afraid of time, especially the ticking of the crocodile's clock, and of his own blood, which reminds him of his vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p class="quote">"The good form... does it ever truly matter?" - Captain Hook</p>
