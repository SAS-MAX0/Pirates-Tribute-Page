            <h2>Barbossa's Origins</h2>
            <p>Hector Barbossa was once a good sailor before he became a pirate. He was smart and cruel, and became the captain of the *Black Pearl*. Wanting more power, he took over the ship by betraying Captain Jack Sparrow. Barbossa and his crew became cursed after finding treasure, turning them into skeletons until Elizabeth Turner broke the curse.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Too long my fate has not been in me own hands... No longer." - Hector Barbossa</p>

            <h2>The *Black Pearl* and the Curse</h2>
            <p>Barbossa's life changed when he betrayed Jack Sparrow and took control of the *Black Pearl*. After finding the cursed Aztec gold, Barbossa and his crew became undead, unable to feel anything or die. He tried to break the curse by finding all the missing gold pieces, which led to many adventures and fights with Jack Sparrow and his crew.</p>
            <p class="quote">"The curse is real, and there’s no escape." - Hector Barbossa</p>

            <h2>Return from the Dead</h2>
            <p>After Jack Sparrow killed him, Barbossa was brought back to life by the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. She wanted his help to free the goddess Calypso. Barbossa then teamed up with Jack Sparrow again to fight the East India Trading Company and Davy Jones. Although he died once more in the battle, his legacy lived on.</p>

            <h2>Barbossa's Legacy</h2>
            <p>Barbossa's life was shaped by his cleverness, leadership, and ability to survive. After coming back to life, he searched for the Fountain of Youth, fought Blackbeard, and returned to piracy. His greatest legacy was his daughter, Carina Smyth, who kept the Barbossa name alive after he sacrificed himself to save her from the ghost pirate Salazar.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I may have been a pirate, but I had my moments of greatness." - Hector Barbossa</p>
